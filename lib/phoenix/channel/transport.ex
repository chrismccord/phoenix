  Handles dispatching incoming and outgoing Channel messages

  ## The Transport Adapter Contract

  The Transport layer dispatches `%Phoenix.Socket.Message{}`'s from remote clients,
  backed by different Channel transport implementations and serializations.

  ### Server

  To implement a Transport adapter, the Server must broker the following actions:

    * Handle receiving incoming, encoded `%Phoenix.Socket.Message{}`'s from
      remote clients, then deserialing and fowarding message through
      `Phoenix.Transport.dispatch/2`. Finish by keeping state of returned
      HashDict of `%Phoenix.Socket{}`s. Message keys must be deserialized as strings.
    * Handle receiving outgoing `{:socket_reply, %Phoenix.Socket.Message{}}` as
      Elixir process messages, then encoding and fowarding to remote client.
    * Handle receiving outgoing `{:socket_broadcast, %Phoenix.Socket.Message{}}` as
      Elixir process messages, then forwarding message through
      `Phoenix.Transport.dispatch_broadcast/2`. Finish by keeping state of returned
      HashDict of `%Phoenix.Socket{}`s.
    * Handle remote client disconnects and relaying event through
      `Phoenix.Transport.dispatch_leave/2`

  See `Phoenix.Transports.WebSocket` for an example transport server implementation.


  ### Remote Client

  Phoenix includes a JavaScript client for WebSocket and Longpolling support using JSON
  encodings.

  However, a client can be implemented for other protocols and encodings by
  abiding by the `Phoenix.Socket.Message` format

  See `web/static/js/phoenix.js` for an example transport client implementation.
